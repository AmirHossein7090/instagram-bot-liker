# How can i contribute?

You must create a new `develop` branch with a number and commit your codes on this new branch. </br>
For example, `develop_1`
</br>
To write test, create a `tests` directory if not exists and write your tests there. </br>
</br>
If you have a new idea to improve performance of the bot, it is welcome :) </br>
</br>
_Thanks and best regards._
